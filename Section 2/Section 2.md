- People may use the same term with different meanings.

---

##  Key Insights

- **Data-centered careers are new** and evolving rapidly.
- Terminologies are often blurred and used loosely.
- Instead of memorizing definitions:
  - Focus on **understanding the work**

---

##  Two Important Guidelines

1. **Expect Different Interpretations**  
   Don't be surprised when different companies or people define roles differently.

2. **Grasp the Essence Over the Label**  
   Understanding the tasks and value behind a role matters more than the title.

# 6. Relevant Terms Explained
##  Key Business & Data Terms – Clarified

 
Objective: Understand core concepts like business, data, analysis, analytics, BI, and data science.



##  What is a Business?

> A **business** is an ongoing activity that operates on a **for-profit** basis.

- Exists to generate revenue.
- "Business" in any term (e.g., business analytics) implies a financial goal.
- Not all data analysis is for profit (e.g., optimizing traffic flow).

---

##  What is Data?

> **Data** = Information gathered for reference or analysis.

- Businesses collect data to:
  - Track performance
  - Make better decisions

---

##  Types of Data

| Type             | Description                        | Example                             |
|------------------|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Qualitative**  | Descriptive, text-based, non-numeric | Customer reviews, case studies     |
| **Quantitative** | Numeric, measurable                 | Units sold, revenue, conversion rate|

---

##  Analysis vs. Analytics

| Term        | Focus        | Description                                                                 |
|-------------|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Analysis**| Past         | Breaking data into parts to understand historical performance                |
| **Analytics**| Future      | Applying logic/statistics to predict future trends from existing data parts |

---

##  Related Fields

###  Business Intelligence (BI)
- Studies **past performance**
- Uses relational databases + reports
- Encompasses both business and data analysis

###  Data Science
- Sometimes includes all data-related work
- Often involves **machine learning** & predictive models
- Other times viewed as **umbrella** for:
  - Business analysis
  - Data analysis/analytics
  - Forecasting

---

##  Key Point

> **Terminology varies** widely — many people misuse or reinterpret terms.

Don’t obsess over labels.  
Focus on mastering the **activities** behind each role.


# 7. Data Analyst Compared to Other Data Jobs

#  Data Analyst vs Other Data Roles
 
Goal: Understand how the data analyst role compares with business experts and other data professionals.

---

##  What Do We Mean by "Data"?

Unless specified otherwise:  
> **"Data" = Quantitative data** (numerical, statistical, measurable)

Thus, data-related tasks involve:
- **Mathematics & Statistics**
- **Programming** (e.g., Python, SQL)

---

##  What Do We Mean by "Business"?

> "Business" = Economic activity focused on making profit (via growth or cost reduction)

|-------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **Business Expert** | Domain-specific knowledge | Industry insight, value creation strategies     |
| **Data Expert**    | Quantitative problem solving | Math, stats, coding, generalizable techniques   |

> ✅ Business and Data people work **together** to drive decisions.

---

##  Role of a Data Analyst

- Blends **analysis** (past) and **analytics** (future)
- Applies:
  - Statistical tools to explain what happened
  - Predictive techniques to forecast what’s next
- Builds a bridge between:
